<P>The experience of being a cook was a wonderful experience and memory of myself. Before I continued my studies at the Degree level, I worked at a leading and famous restaurant in Penang. It provides traditional lebanese food, western food and food traditions of the Malays. I have been working at the restaurant for a year. I have worked diligently and learned a lot from great chefs like Chef Riz, Chef Airil and Chef Zafuan. They have provided knowledge on professional level cuisine. I am also proficient in western and traditional Malay cuisine. I also got 3rd place in the Young Chef competition in Kuala Lumpur. The experience of working in the restaurant I started working from 8 am to 11 pm. Working as a cook is like that, a job that is definitely tiring but fun because it can provide food to customers and they enjoy the food happily With friends or with family. All my tired work pays off when I see customers enjoying the food with happiness.</P>
